  <h2>Help build a stronger organization</h2>
  <p>Code for San Francisco is a collection of creative volunteers working to improve the lives of San Franciscans. We have grown a lot recently: from 400 people in January 2014 to 1700 people in July 2015. We continue to advocate for open public data, we continue to build useful civic apps like LocalFreeWeb and SF in Progress, and we continue to work on civic infrastructure like BallotAPI and OpenReferral.</p>
  <p><b>But <u>we want to do more</u> and to do it better.</b> To that end, we are building our leadership team.</p>
  <p>The positions on the teams below are unpaid volunteer positions, but the work is rewarding and a lot of fun. Get in on building an entirely new model of civic engagement and action. You can apply into a team and indicate interest in either leading or supporting the team. Each team will have one leader ultimately responsible for delivering on the vision, but will likely be supported by several others in that work. While the teams support core, important functions of the Brigade, all core team members will work collaboratively together across teams as well. Read more about the teams below and apply using the form to the right. If you need assistance in your application, please email hello@codeforsanfrancisco.org.</p>
