    <h1>About Code for San Francisco</h1>
    <p>Code for San Francisco is a group of people, first and foremost. We also call ourselves technologists, planners, designers, doers, thinkers, and activists. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-San-Francisco-Civic-Hack-Night/">Each week</a>, we actively work together to improve the City and County of San Francisco, often <a href="https://github.com/sfbrigade">using technology</a> to support our efforts. By connecting people, organizations, resources, tools, and networks to build for San Francisco, we will all thrive.</p>

    <h2>Brigade</h2>
    <p>Code for San Francisco is a local chapter of the Code for America Brigade, an international network of people committed to using their voices and hands, in collaboration with local governments, to make their cities better.</p>

    <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>Code for San Francisco holds it’s leadership and participants to a Code of Conduct, which applys to our meetups, events, and digital forums. Read our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZV_iy2CeDlTu13Af9-_5NyOC8SVP9mpxIBn0g1e_S-Q/edit">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>Code for San Francisco is a safe space for experimentation, learning and practicing skills, taking chances, and asking questions, all to affect and encourage positive change. Whenever possible, we proactively reach out to those who are left out, excluded, ignored, or discriminated against. Those people, in our opinion, represent our most desirable source for experiences, knowledge, and thoughts. We fail without their involvement.
