    <h3>Pitch and lead project</h3>
    <p>Got a great idea? Or even some code already that you want help on? Great! Take a look at the project guidelines, register for NDoCH SF, and submit your project. Requirements: prep time to develop the idea and action plan for your project, recruiting a team during the Friday night opening party, attending Saturday and Sunday to work on the project, and presenting with your team on Sunday night. You do not need technical expertise to propose a project, but it is good to work with someone who had some technical skills while at the event.</p>

    <h3>Lead a National Challenge</h3>
    <p>Do you want to be the point person for a challenge? Challenges are projects that have been set up and released by Code for America for this year's National Day of Civic Hacking. This could be taking a project from another city and adapting it to San Francisco, or turning a data set into a visualization, or plenty of other things. Requirements: some prep time to look up the needs of the project (up to 5 hours), recruiting a team during the Fri event, attending Sat/Sun to work on the challenge. You do not need technical expertise to lead a challenge.</p>
