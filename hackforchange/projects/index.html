      <h1>Building the Water-Resilient City of the Future</h1>
      <h5><b>Team Lead:</b> Tom Ferguson</h5>
      <p>The struggle for clean water is the challenge of our time. We’re entrepreneurs, so to us, that means it’s our greatest opportunity. Ever thought about where your water comes from? How much you use? Whether it will be there tomorrow when you turn on your tap? Over a billion people lack access to clean water. Right now. Even in the US, pollution, scarcity, and a crumbling system of pipes and facilities threaten our water supply. Availability of clean water and sanitation will be the dominant issue of the coming decades, touching everything from human life to health and economics. We’re turning these problems into opportunities.</p>

      <h1>We Vote USA</h1>
      <h5><b>Team Lead:</b> Dan Ancona, Chief Evangelist of We Vote USA </h5>

      <p>We Vote USA is a nonprofit volunteer-driven movement, dedicated to educating citizens and bringing social collaboration to the process of making voting decisions. We are building an open platform for citizens to create and share personal voter guides that aggregate information and opinions, across their social networks.

      We are volunteer designers, engineers, thought leaders, political junkies, and good citizens. We contribute our time and passion because we feel political decisions should be made following clear-headed conversations as opposed to through epic media battles, cast in terms of good versus evil.

      We are inspired by groups like Code for America, the Peace Corps, the Wikimedia Foundation, and the Mozilla Foundation. We are guided by our Values.</p>

      <h1>Two Factor Frenzy</h1>
      <h5><b>Team Lead:</b>   Kurt Hepler</h5>
      <p>This challenge calls for a tool (e.g., website, app, game) designed to show users which sites currently offer multi-factor authentication (MFA), with information tailored to them based on their online habits.

      By adopting multifactor authentication (MFA), individuals can enhance the security and privacy of their online transactions. Thus, it’s imperative to help the public gain a deeper understanding of the importance of MFA, and to increase MFA adoption and the safety of online transactions.</p>
