    <div id="about">
      <p>Passionate neighbors, urbanists, civic hackers, developers, designers, government staff, and community organizers from across the globe will come together to improve their communities and governments. Here in San Francisco, we will be focused on
        tackling challenges and projects in open data, health, safety and justice, economic development, climate, disaster relief, oceans, and mapping. Come to join a project, to test solutions out with residents, to hone skills at workshops, or to just
        see what is going on.</p>
      <h2>Shared Prosperity Agenda + National Day of Civic Hacking</h2>
      <p>In January 2015, Mayor Lee announced the <a href="http://sfmayor.org/index.aspx?page=1028">Shared Prosperity Agenda</a> – offering specific activities that the City will undertake for its citizens in the areas of housing, education, transportation,
        women’s empowerment, and anti-poverty. The National Day of Civic Hacking is a chance for residents to prototype and test out their own solutions in these same issue areas, offering complementary projects to those being envisioned by the government.
