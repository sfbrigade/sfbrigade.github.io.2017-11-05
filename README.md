# CodeForSanFrancisco.org

The website for the Code for San Francisco Brigade

### Goals
1. Explain what Code for San Francisco is and the type of work we do.
2. To celebrate our events, projects, and discussions!
4. Encourage current and new members to participate with clear ways to get involved.
5. To have this site be easily reused by other Brigades just starting out.

## Blogging Instructions
If you are tasked with writing posts for the site blog, follow these instructions:

What you'll need:
- a github account with access to the sfbrigade github organization.
(ask somebody at san francisco brigade for this)

To create a new post:
- go to http://prose.io/#sfbrigade/sfbrigade.github.io/tree/master/_posts/blog
- if the page asks you to "authorize with github", click the authorize button
note: ensure you are signed in with your github account
- create a new blog post by clicking the "new file" button
there are various controls for formatting text, links and creating images

To add an image:
- click on the add image button.
- click "selecting one".
- pick a file on your local computer.
- in the "image url" field, ensure to change the url from something like
"_posts/blog/yourimagename.jpg"
to
"images/blog/yourimagename.jpg"
this is changing the path of the image to be images/blog/ rather then _posts/blog.
!this is important, as the image will not work if this is not done!
- add in alt text for the image. alt text is important for user's that browse by websites using text readers.

### Tech

Built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), and the [CfAPI](https://github.com/codeforamerica/cfapi).

## Contributing

### <a name="issues"></a>Submitting an Issue

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sfbrigade/sfbrigade.github.io/issues) to track bugs and features. We've included several of our open GitHub Issues right on our homepage using the [Civic Tech Issue Finder](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues).

### Running the Site Locally on Your Computer

To run the site locally on your own computer (most helpful for previewing your own changes), you will need Jekyll installed ([click here for Jekyll installation instructions](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).)

Fork and clone the repository, then install dependencies (requires **ruby** and **bundler**).

```` sh
cd sfbrigade.github.io/
bundle install
````

Finally, run the following command in the root directory of the repo:

    $ bundle exec jekyll serve

or

    $ bundle exec jekyll serve --watch

The latter will cause Jekyll to watch for file changes and automatically
regenerate the HTML (though you will still need to refresh the browser).
If the `--watch` flag does not work, try the following instead:

    $ bundle exec jekyll serve --force_polling

(See [here](https://github.com/guard/listen/wiki/Troubleshooting) for
background information on why `--watch` might not be working.)


Your computer should now be serving your local copy of the site at:

* [http://0.0.0.0:4000](http://0.0.0.0:4000)

If the above URL does not work (e.g. when using Chrome), try:

* [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000)

(See [this issue](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/3048) for more
information.)


### Sharing Your Changes Using Jekit

You can use the nifty [Jekit](https://jekit.codeforamerica.org/) app to preview changes you make to this site.

To do this, fork this repo, and commit your changes on a branch to your fork. You can then preview what your changes look like by navigating to:

https://jekit.codeforamerica.org/USERNAME/sfbrigade.github.io/BRANCHNAME/

For a basic example of its usage, if GitHub user **@lolname** has made changes to the projects page on their fork (on the `master` branch), they can preview their changes using Jekit by going to:

https://jekit.codeforamerica.org/lolname/sfbrigade.github.io/master/projects

### Submitting a Pull Request
