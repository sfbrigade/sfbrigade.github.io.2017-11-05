<p>Code Utah, Open Salt Lake's Summer Open Data Coding Competition is underway, but it's not too late to get in on the action.</p>
<p>We've got teams working on air quality, food deserts, and bike lane applications all using data from the <a href="https://opendata.utah.gov/" target="_blank">State Open Data Portal</a>. We're hoping more teams will form to demonstrate that open data is a valuable resource for developers and that public information can help solve local problems.</p>
