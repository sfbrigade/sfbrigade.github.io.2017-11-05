<p>It's summer and everyone is out of town or riding their bike, so we are going to take some time off and start up our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Open-Salt-Lake/" target="_blank">Meet-ups</a> again in August. Â Our next Meet-up will be on Tuesday August 5th at 7:30 . We will also put an end of summer event together more to come on that.</p>
<p>We also have a new Captain Mark Parthum! Kris Trujillo is stepping down to try and keep up with all demands of being a big wig software director. But he will still be apart of the brigade and support us with our Open Data Catalogue.</p>
