<p>Open Salt Lake is in build mode -- growing both our membership and our impact. By creating partnerships with the local developer community, we're bringing greater attention and talent to civic hacking for public good.</p>
<p>This Wednesday, at our <strong><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Open-Salt-Lake/events/221528976/">April Hack Night</a></strong>, we will join forces with <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/salt-lake-city" target="_blank"><strong>Girl Develop It-SLC</strong></a> for an evening of open source activity.</p>
<p>Amanda Walter, one of Open Salt Lake’s newest additions and a long-standing GDI member, will kick things off with a brief intro to open source development and civic hacking resources.</p>
<p>Several OSL members will do lighting presentations on open source civic tech project opportunities for folks to hack on, and we’ll break into groups to move these forward. (You can always take the time to work on your own projects as well.)</p>
<p>Bring your tech skills, meet some new folks, and help make a difference.</p>
<p>Look forward to seeing you there.</p>
