<p class="x_MsoNormal"><em><strong>Deadline Extended to April 10, 2015</strong></em></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b><i>Are you a developer, entrepreneur, or designer looking to impact your community?  </i></b></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Help create the next generation of health technology.   Salt lake City has partnered with the National League of Cities on this year’s national effort and need your ideas and participation to create the next big technology that promotes healthy communities.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Twenty-five leading local and state governments across the country are partnering to prove that cities and regions can work together in a new way to work with developer, creative, and entrepreneurial communities to improve public and community health and spur quality innovation.  Each city will pay $5,000 to the developer team, if it chooses to deploy the new technology in their community, for a total of up to $120,000.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.jsf.co/" target="_blank">Jumpstart Foundry</a>, one of the country's leading health technology startup accelerators, is partnering with the cities and regions to launch the next game-changing, sustainable, and scalable technology.  The accelerator program has committed to reserving a finalist spot from the MCIC program to be considered for its flagship summer 2015 cohort in Nashville, TN, with available seed capital of up to $100,000.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Developers can submit their ideas at <a href="http://2015cityinnovation.populr.me/" target="_blank">www.multicityinnovation.org</a> by April 10!</p>
