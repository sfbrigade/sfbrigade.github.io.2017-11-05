<p>Easily finding and using public data is a core principle of 21st Century government. Our goal is to take public data from Utah's new open data portal (<a class="linkified" href="http://www.utah.gov/data/">http://www.utah.gov/data/</a>) and make it actionable, addressing local needs through visualizations, new apps, and tools for the community. More than 1300 datasets are currently hosted on the portal and the State has committed to finding and posting any other public data that developers want to use throughout the Summer Open Data Drive.</p>
<p>We will launch, in conjunction with NDoCH at ImpactHub SLC (<a class="linkified" href="http://saltlake.impacthub.net/">http://saltlake.impacthub.net/</a>), on Saturday, June 6th. The launch party will introduce participants to the open data available and groups will start forming to explore ways that open data and technology can improve issues ranging from health to food access to education to climate change. Over the course of the summer, there will be many learning opportunities and teams will work on digital solutions that use open data, culminating in a juried demo day and hack session in late August with prizes and awards in a range of categories. Join Open Salt Lake in placing open data in the hands of developers and communities to drive toward greater impact.</p>
