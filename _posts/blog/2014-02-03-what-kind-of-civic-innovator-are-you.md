<p>A <a href="http://www.businessofgovernment.org/sites/default/files/Engaging%20Citizens%20in%20Co-Creation%20in%20Public%20Service.pdf" target="_blank">new report</a> by the IBM Center for the Business of Government titled, <em>Engaging Citizens in Co-Creation in Public Services,</em>  defines four key roles members of the community can play in conjunction with their government.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>As <span style="line-height:1.5;"> </span></strong><span style="line-height:1.5;"><strong>explorers</strong>,citizens can identify/discover and define emerging and existing problems.</span></li>
<li><strong style="line-height:1.5;">As ideators,</strong><span style="line-height:1.5;"> citizens can conceptualize novel solutions to well-defined problems.</span></li>
<li><strong style="line-height:1.5;"> As designers,</strong><span style="line-height:1.5;"> citizens can design and/or develop implementable solutions to well-defined </span><span style="line-height:1.5;">problems.</span></li>
<li><strong>As diffusers,</strong> citizens can directly support or facilitate the adoption and diffusion of public service innovations and solutions among well-defined target populations.</li>
</ul>
