<p>A few of us from Open Salt Lake are in Oakland this year to participate in the annual Code for America Summit.  We're meeting up with other Brigade chapters from around the country (and world), sharing projects and lessons, and getting excited about the many ways digital services and user centered design are helping government work for and by the people in the 21st century.  Watch from home with the <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/#livestream" target="_blank">live stream </a>and Twitter feed (#cfasummit).  We'll share more info when we get back to Salt Lake City about the ideas and energy we're bringing home.</p>
