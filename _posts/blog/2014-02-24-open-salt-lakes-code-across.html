<p>The Code Across event for Open Salt Lake was productive. We worked on two projects, the US Cities Open Data Census and the Salt Lake City open Data Policy. These two projects complimented each other as we went through the census exercise searching for data sets we were able to identify the strengths and weaknesses. Â We discussed and reviewed the draft open data policy and noted places where Salt Lake City may be able to strengthen their open data portal.</p>

<p>We talked about building upon our ideas site and the need to recruit new ideas or to see if we can get someone working on the ones we have. Please take a look at our <a href="http://opensaltlake.uservoice.com/forums/205305-opensl">Ideas Page</a> and offer up a comment or suggestion or hey take on one of the great ideas already there.</p>
