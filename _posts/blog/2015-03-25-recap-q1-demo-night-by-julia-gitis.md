On Wed Mar 18, we hosted our first demo night at the brigade! It was awesome to see what kind of projects our members are working on.

Trent Robbins presented GetSocrata. He is bilding an api wrapper to get data from Socrata ("the world leader in cloud solutions for open data and data-driven governments").

Yariv Rabinovitch presented the Bicycle Newbie Initiative. They are deploying a project for connecting experienced and newbie bicyclists during commutes. How great is that?

Sheffield Hale represented the Open Health Data Team, which is working on mapping ads for unhealthy products like tobacco and soda, like how many ads are within walking distance of schools.

Patrick Stern presented Parksafe. His team is looking to provide parking confidence for drivers in SF. They are building an app that informs users on rules surrounding potential ticketing situations.

Mike Hernandez presented SF in Progress. They are bringing more awareness and advocacy to citizens. For example, his team gives citizens a chance to show up at public hearings and get their voices heard.

Jeremy Lucas presented Project Blip- promoting online safety, security, and privacy.

Jason Lally represented SF Social Services Open Referral Database. They are mapping social services so that folks can more easily find them. Isn't that great?

Greg Arenius presented BallotAPI- make it really easy to find out what's on your ballot.

Peter Hall presented Campaign Finance Visualization- different ways to look at data around campaign finance. Their team uses data to check that people are following the law. 

Finally, Jason Lally went over the Code for San Francisco website (yes, the one you're looking at now). How can we create a website that meets the needs of the communities we serve?

Then on Wed Mar 25, 3 teams that didn't get a chance to present last week presented their work. Chris Jerdonek presented on SF Election Data. Scott presented on [World University and School](http://worlduniversityandschool.org/), which is free high quality online wiki education. David Biel presented [SFHomeless.net](http://sfhomeless.net), a valuable resource in wiki format.

Come to our hack nights to meet these teams, support their work, and learn more.
