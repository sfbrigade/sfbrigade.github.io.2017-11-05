##Captain Description
Jesse and Maddie are both expecting new members to their families in January. Your role will be to internalize the vision for Code for San Francisco and maintain an overall understanding of all of the brigade’s moving parts.

When the brigade stops moving forward, you must inspire and work with others to break that stagnation. 

Functionally, you will work with the Executive Coordinator to handle any and all tasks that others cannot fulfil, no matter what they are, in order to sustain and advance Code for San Francisco’s efforts. You will likely be the first to arrive and the last to leave, you will direct people with questions to the appropriate Core Team, and you will provide counsel and advice to folks who simply need to connect with someone at Code for SF. 

Other duties include:

- Build and maintain a respectful and productive relationship with municipal partner and local government.
- Be ultimately responsible for all activities involving Code for San Francisco
- Commit to making your Brigade look like the community the Brigade is in.
